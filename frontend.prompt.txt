The front-end will allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It will have a very simple one-page UI. If no session is detected on loading, a modal will appear that allow the user to login, register, or select a demo account that will store the data in local storage. 

When the user is logged in, the front-end will display a list of tasks. The user can add a new task, edit an existing task, or delete a task. The user can also logout. 

The front-end will use the backend API to perform the CRUD operations on the tasks. The backend API is hosted on a different server and is protected by a JWT token. The frontend will use the fetch API to make requests to the backend API. 

The front-end will use the following technologies:
- React
- React Router
- React Context API
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Fetch API
- React Query
- React Hook Form
- React Toastify
- React Icons
- React Loader Spinner

This will be implemented in the ./client folder.
